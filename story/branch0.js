With no other direction to go, you continue straight ahead until you see a faint light in the middle of the path. You move in to get a closer look. A white bird sits on a branch. #9 Its pure white feathers draw in your eyes, commanding your attention. Its body emanates an otherworldly glow that makes it stand out from the surrounding darkness. It remains fixated on you; bright blue eyes cast a gaze deeper than the surrounding night. The rain slows down to a steady pace, and you begin to hear a voice. {White Bird: Are you lost my friend? Perhaps I can be of some use?} The bird twitched its head, somehow speaking without moving its beak. {Cora: My name is Cora. I’m a forest guardian, and lucky for you, I help guide lost people like you.} The sound of falling rain surrounds the two of you.

She’s only there to test your resolve, and the only way to overcome her is to take that which she values most.} ^ @4 A strange white dagger appears at your feet.

Spreading its wings, Cora moves it’s head at lightning speed turning your torso into a disgusting heap of spaghetti. Gore seeps out and mixes with the sludge beneath you. You twitch; you’re in an immeasurable amount of pain. White light begins to envelope your vision, and your last bits of strength start to fade. {Cora: You’ve quite the nerve.} Cora gulps down a hunk of your innards. {Cora: Decided to listen to that whore over me huh?} Cora penetrates you one last time, going deeper and harder than before. It grinded its beak sending fiery pain through every last nerve. {Cora: Such a waste.} Cora perches on you. @4 Your head rolls to the side and you see the dagger in plain sight. Above the dagger is a white light. +1 The light forms into what you think is the shape of a beautiful woman; she looks familiar. {Female Voice: Come find me!} Her glowing hand guides yours to the dagger. % You wrap your finger around it; Cora doesn’t seem to notice the light nor the dagger. Using your last bits of strength, you plunge the dagger straight through Cora’s head and roll on top of it. @7 Like a maniac, you hurl the knife again and again and again through every part of its body. Each penetration giving you more satisfaction, you keep going until Cora is nothing more than an unrecognizable heap of gore. You fall over, and Cora remains motionless. The two of you fade into a white oblivion. {<b>Gaia End</b>. <i>Click to continue</i>.} Play again?",

You quickly realize that what you just ate definitely was not a chocolate or a sweet of any kind. The flavors are beyond description. Your mouth is filled with a sensation that feels more raw and visceral than you’ve ever felt before. Your body grows hot, your skin sensitive. A soothing earthy, natural flavor swirls about your tongue. It's a taste you’ve never quite experienced before, slightly musky, but savory, soft, but warm, smooth, yet sensational. You look up and your vision is waving, your heart is racing. The nude woman stands before you smiling with her arms crossed. #1 {Beautiful Woman: Mhm, hehe. Thought so.} She shoots you a flirtatious wink. #6 {Willow: Before we start, I thought you’d like to know my name. It’s Willow; I’m a goddess of instinct and pleasure.} Her words barely reach, as each one passes through you abnormally slow. You have trouble listening, all you can manage to do is stare at her full lips; they slowly form each individual syllable. You long to feel them. As you’ve stared at Willow, you realize that you’ve taken nearly five steps towards her without even realizing. Her curvaceous body becomes more full and attractive, and her skin more irresistibly soft. Your eyes stroke her every contour, filling your heart with a wild pulsing sensation. Your breath is so heavy by this point, you’re breathing from your mouth. Willow runs a few fingers through her long white hair, flipping it over her neck before speaking; her face just inches from yours. She giggles as her lips softly form words. {Willow: That was my heart you just ate.} {Willow: Hehe, you can’t take it with you, so you’re stuck here with me now!} #4 The two of you lock lips and passionately exchange. You feel a primal urge surging about you. Your craving for her soft flesh is satiated with every stroke of her nude body. Curves, warmth, you feel her beating heart inside you along with your own. The feeling of two bodies and two lives inside each other as one. The sensation begins to grate on your mind and drive you insane. You struggle to breathe, gasping for air and drowning with pleasure. White begins to close in at all angles, as pleasure electrifies and sends you into shock! An excess of warmth and intensity exceeds your ability to process. % {Willow: Hehe, Don’t trust the gate next time, my love.} Your world becomes shrouded in light, and all is lost. {<b>Willow End</b>. <i>Click to continue</i>.} Play again?",

      text: "$2 #5 You refuse her gift and let her keep the food. Her face forms a genuine look of shock. Silence falls between the two of you and only the sound of rain prevails. {Beautiful Woman: I was wrong. You aren’t interested in my body, nor in pleasure at all.} #7 {Beautiful Woman: You seem to have your heart set on a goal, and you won’t stop until it’s met.} She puts a finger to her lip and looks down in deep thought. {Yara: Well then, my name is Yara. I’m a goddess of wisdom and knowledge.} {Yara: Please, come take a walk with me. I’ll impart what knowledge I can, and by the end of it, you’ll have another opportunity to get that which you seek.} ^ @7 You walk side by side with the goddess through the rainy forest. You’ve grown used to the water by this point and aren’t particularly bothered by it. @6 #7 You look over to her as she takes each step slowly; her eyes closed. With one arm tucked snugly under her bust and the other touching her finger to her lip, she looks as if she's thinking deeply or even performing a walking meditation. After what seemed like an eternity, Yara finally spoke up. #1 {Yara: Mmm. Yes, so. It appears that you’re stuck in a loop of sorts.} {Yara: I can’t really tell who you are or even why you’re here, but so long as you wander this forest, those answers will remain suspended from you, just out of reach.} #7 You continue walking side by side with her; the rain glistened off her bare skin. To you, this area was a treacherous nightmare, but seeing her so calmly walk through the elements made it seem like she was right at home. #1 {Yara: If a tree falls in the forest, and nobody's around to hear it, does it make a sound? Surely you’ve heard this before, yes?} Yara turns to you. You nod silently and she continues. {Yara: Well, Right now you’re the tree, and no one has heard you fall. You’ve now the unique opportunity to choose which sound you make. Only once you leave this forest, however, will anyone hear.} #7 You struggle to keep up with her, barely understanding what she’s talking about or how it relates. Before long she stops and faces you. {Yara: So let me explain. I’m not sure if this is your first time through, but as soon as our conversation finishes, this path will end, I’ll cease to exist, and you’ll go back to the beginning of the forest and open your eyes.} {Yara: Everyone and everything lurking here will have no idea of what you’ve encountered. That includes me, my dear.} Yara looks you straight in the eye. #1 {Yara: Obviously you’ll keep your memories, for you exist on a different plane than I. Me on the other hand? I’m a little different you see.} {Yara: If you haven’t already realized this, you’ll be sure to soon enough. I’ll only say this:} {Yara: Myself, Yara, can only exist in this space, in this time, in this fork.} She holds up her forearm and displays to you the palm of her hand. {Yara: You see these little lines in my hand? Yes, well, we’re somewhere here.} She points to a line in her hand and continues. #7 {Yara: Once you leave this point, I’ll cease to exist. You might see me again, but rest assured, it won’t be me “per say”.} Once more, you struggle to understand her. The only thing you’re sure of is how enigmatic of a woman Yara is. Just who was she? #1 {Yara: It looks like we’re out of time, my love. I’ve had a nice time chatting with you.} {Yara: Consider this nice walk through the woods a small treat. Even the darkest of places have their pleasantries.} She smiles and shoots you a wink. Your heart begins to ache, and a knot forms in your throat. You realize how attached to Yara you’ve grown and begin to dread leaving her. {Yara: Yes, One last thing. I haven’t given you any hints on how to reach your “true ending”, as they call it.} She grins. {Yara: Search the gate carefully. The answer is there.} #4 She leans forward and presses her lips softly to your cheek. You feel your face turn red and your heart skips a beat. % You reach out for her, but all you manage to grab at is thin air. {Yara: Farewell my love, and good luck!} You hear Yara’s voice faintly echo in the breeze, and your world slowly becomes enveloped in a white light. {<b>Yara End</b>. <i>Click to continue</i>.} Play again?",

Any chance to escape is better than going through the hell he’s instructed you. You continue walking forward, aiming straight for the edge of the forest. @7 The rainfall begins to slow down, and the darkness begins to fade. You keep your eyes straight and continue walking. The trees begin to thin as you go along, and you can see more of the surrounding landscape. It’s oddly thin, abnormally so. The only way you can think to describe it is “void”. You feel confused; something must be wrong. Perhaps Cora wasn’t lying? The rain had stopped, it wasn’t night anymore, and all you could see was full blown white. You realize that you must be losing consciousness. Your legs give and you collapse to the ground! Your mind flickers as you reach the edge of your conscience. You see the silhouette of a beautiful woman that you can’t quite recognize. Her back is to you, and you can’t make out any of her features other than her strikingly curvy silhouette. {Female Voice: F-find Babylon! G-go ba-} Her voice cuts off. +2 You try reaching up to touch her, but before your hand reaches, she spins around and plunges a white dagger straight through your heart. You cough up blood, and your vision immediately goes white. With your last fragments of consciousness, all you can make out is her rotting face. Where her eyes should be, all you see are empty voids, darker than the abyss you plunge into. % {<b>Escapist End</b>. <i>Click to continue</i>.} Play again?",

At its center, you see an open archway with white light shining through. The exterior of the tower is a vibrant, colorful shade blue and has symbols of white ravens carved into its surface. You stop and notice the rain finally ceased, and the clouds begin to part. A lush full-moon peeked from the clouds, filling the area with its radiant glow. Stars scattered across the night sky like a bowl of shimmering diamonds. The scene was more vivid than you could have ever dreamed of. You lose yourself in the sky’s beauty and majesty.

Her beauty is just as radiant or more than the breathtaking night sky you had just seen. With each step she takes toward you, her hips sway with the grace and elegance of a goddess. Everything from her body to her movements exude an air of majesty and unmatched beauty, rivaling the stars themselves. {Babylon: Perhaps you’ve gone through a lot to get to this point, or maybe you’ve somehow gotten lucky and completely avoided the abyss?} {Babylon: I’ll never know, for you and I exist on two separate plains.} Babylon smiled gently. #7 {Babylon: Tell me, have you by chance run across Yara? She’s quite the informative one, a unique facet of mine.} % #8 {Babylon: She helps make my job easier by filling in people on how things work around here. Either way, I’ll do my best to explain.} % Babylon turns to sit down; you take a look around her temple and notice how it’s a shrine room of some sort. Burning incense fill the area with a floral aroma, and you notice blue pillows placed neatly along the stone flooring. After some time, Babylon sits and offers you some tea; the two of you sip and face one another. #8 {Babylon: So this is it, the end of your journey.} Babylon took a long sip on her cup of tea. Closing her eyes, she began speaking. {Babylon: In case you haven’t figured it out, I’m a goddess, one that controls truth and enlightenment. I watch over the abyss; a place that exist in the shadow of unfulfilled potential.} {Babylon: Things that happen in the abyss never come to pass, and it’s only when we cross through the illusions we make for ourselves that we arrive here.} She opens her eyes and gazes directly at you. You notice a soft compassion but firmness to her demeanor. {Babylon: Perhaps you understand now? The way forward was never blocked, it was you who blocked the path yourself.} {Babylon: The way forward was always there, but tucked just out of sight.} Babylon held out her arm to the side and after a few seconds, a white raven appeared out of thin air, perching itself on her shoulder. #9 {Babylon: I imagine you’re quite eager to blame this one. Well don’t. It’s just as much a part of you as I am.} {Babylon: Both of us are your creations.} % #8 Babylon shakes her arm and the bird vanishes. The two of you silently exchange glances. You begin to lose yourself in her eyes. There was a certain mesmerizing quality about her. The more she talked, the more you listened. The more she stared, the more you wanted to meet her gaze. Babylon’s presence was definitely unavoidable. A rush of emotions hit you as you stare into her eyes. Compassion, worry, fear, and most of all, you feel a strange attachment to her; maybe love? You aren’t sure. But before you have the chance to contemplate, your vision narrows and white begins to close in on all sides. {Babylon: Our time is just about up. In a few moments you’ll leave here, and I won’t be able to follow you.} {Babylon: But before you go, I’ll leave you with one last thing.} She leans in close, her full lips come just inches away from yours; she slowly opens her mouth and brings it to your ear. Babylon whispers softly, revealing to you her last secret. {Babylon: This world has no end, and will follow you everywhere you go.} {Babylon: You’ll always have a raven to distract you from me.} {Babylon: But I’ll always be waiting for you, at every victory, at every peak, at every journey’s end.} {Babylon: I’ll be there to share a cup of tea with you.} She kisses you on the forehead, and you savor the feeling of her soft skin one last time.
